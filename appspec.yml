# AppSpec Configuration for AWS Code Deploy
os: linux 

# We need to copy our artifacts over to the tomcat applications directory, which is /usr/share/tomcat<Version>/webapps
# This can be replaced with an environment variable reference defined in the 
# AWS instance - for example 

files:
  - source: mycompany.war
    destination: /deployment

# Before the application is deployed, Tomcat needs to be stopped and 
# the existing applications cleaned up, otherwise, AWS Codedeploy will not
# overwrite the files.
